## Bugs
There was a bug causing an error in the width of the navigation bar and the footer, they were wider than the header and the main content section. I tried fixing it by going back over videos in the course and using google to try find a fix but nothing I tried worked. I spoke to my mentor about it during our mid project meeting and he identified that it was down to the margins. To fix the issue I used the CSS to give a general margin to all elements on my page and removed margins from individual elements.

No unfixed bugs
